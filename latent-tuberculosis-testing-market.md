<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Latent tuberculosis Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)</li><li>Interferon Gamma Released Assay (IGRA)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The latent tuberculosis testing market includes two primary types: the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and Interferon Gamma Released Assays (IGRA). TST involves intradermal injection of a tuberculin solution, assessing immune response after 48-72 hours. IGRA, a blood test, measures immune response to specific TB antigens, offering quicker results and reduced false positives in vaccinated individuals. Both methods cater to different patient profiles and settings, influencing their usage in diagnosing latent tuberculosis infections amidst varying healthcare needs.</p></p>
