<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In Vitro Toxicity Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dose Response</li><li>Threshold Response</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The in vitro toxicity market is primarily categorized into two types: dose-response and threshold response. The dose-response approach evaluates the relationship between the concentration of a substance and the biological effect it produces, helping to determine toxicity levels. In contrast, the threshold response method identifies a specific concentration below which no adverse effects occur, signaling a safe exposure limit. Both approaches are essential for assessing chemical safety and regulatory compliance in drug development and environmental assessment.</p></p>
