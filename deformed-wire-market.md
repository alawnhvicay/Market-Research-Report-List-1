<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deformed Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Cold-Drawn Deformed Wire"</li><li>"Hot-Rolled Deformed Wire"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The deformed wire market is primarily categorized into two types: cold-drawn deformed wire and hot-rolled deformed wire. Cold-drawn deformed wire is produced by drawing steel through a die at room temperature, resulting in increased strength and improved surface finish. Conversely, hot-rolled deformed wire is manufactured by rolling steel at high temperatures, which allows for easier shaping but can result in lower tensile strength compared to its cold-drawn counterpart. Both types are essential in construction and reinforcing applications.</p></p>
